Problems with nutrition:
	Pakistani children specifically are in crisis with malnutrition. There are many cases where children are stunted because of lack of nutrition and or lack of enough calories to sustain a healthy diet. 10 million Pakistani children are affected by stunting. This causes the children to not grow to their full height and weight. This comes a lot from some of the issues with growing food in the nation that is prone to natural disasters and not ideal for farming.  
	Another issue specifically for children caused by this lack of nutrition and caloric deficit is the literal wasting away of fat and muscle tissue until there is very little left but skin, bone, and organs. This is compounded by the fact that only about 1/3 of the mothers breastfeed their children until the age of six months. Breastmilk can be difficult to produce enough quantity and the quality suffers because of the nutritional issues in the country. Consequently, There are sever deficiencies in children under 5 for vitamin A, vitamin D and Zinc in particular as well as over half of the children in that range are anemic.
